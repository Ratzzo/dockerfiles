This container has an alpine image with self contained openrc. 
It clones my updater_git_stub repo and sets up an user to connect to it using ssh

Files on this folder:
- init.sh		-- This is the docker entrypoint. 
						It starts the services and generates a ssh public/private keypair shared/id_rsa and shared/id_rsa.pub
- run.sh		-- The preferred way of running the container
- ssh.sh 		-- The preferred way of connecting using ssh to the container
- shared/		-- The folder where nonvolatile shared files are stored. 
						With the exception of the keypair which is regenerated on each start.
