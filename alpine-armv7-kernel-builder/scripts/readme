These are the scripts for building an alpine image
I've centered everything around the main Makefile

The makefile has targets for downloading and compiling the kernel, and uboot.
As the moment I'm writing this readme, everything is still in development.

The main requirement is to have a RO(read only) file system with secondary RW partition.

The image consists of an ext4 image  filesystem with another (rootfs.ext4) loop image inside containing the main rootfs which 
will be mounted by a modified init script at boot. The loop image is the system. Extra config stuff will be loaded from the apkovl archive.
Everything will be RO, but remountable allowing for full system updates if needed.

The main purpose of this image is to host services using docker which will be preinstalled into the rootfs.ext4.

The building process should be as follows:
    * Kernel, RT Patch and Uboot sources are downloaded.
    * Everything is extracted, and built.
    * Alpine minirootfs archive is downloaded, extracted and chrooted into.
    * From the minirootfs chroot:
        - A rootfs image file is allocated, and a filesystem is formatted onto it. 
        (this will be mounted on / using a modified init script and kernel on boot)
        - The rootfs is bootstrapped as a minimal alpine system with a selection of packages preinstalled.
    * The main image is preallocated, and formatted.
    * The Kernel, Modules, Uboot, Apkovl archive, and rootfs image are merged into the main image.
