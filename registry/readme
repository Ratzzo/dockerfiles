This container contains the docker registry image along with sshd, and nginx.

The registry is listening on port 5000, and proxied through nginx listening on
port 5100. Nginx provides some access control as following:

 - Public registry access is granted under the credentials public:public
 - Private registry access is granted with registry_private.htpasswd

A ssh key is generated at the container run along with credentials for public
readonly registry access, and readwrite access.

Docker registry data is stored on /var/lib/registry, and shared container data
is stored  on /tmp/shared inside the container (registry_private.htpasswd, 
and id_rsa)

we need the volume mount location to exist on the host (obvously):

mkdir -p /var/containers/ratzzo_registry/shared
docker run --name docker_registry \
-p 5100:5100 \
-v docker_registry:/var/lib/registry \
-v /var/containers/ratzzo_registry/shared:/tmp/shared \
--rm -it ratzzo/registry /opt/scripts/entrypoint

To run debug only on the same folder as the Dockerfile.

mkdir -p /var/containers/ratzzo_registry/shared

docker run --name docker_registry \
-p 5100:5100 \
-v docker_registry:/var/lib/registry \
-v /var/containers/ratzzo_registry/shared:/tmp/shared \
-v $PWD/scripts:/opt/scripts \
--rm -it ratzzo/registry /opt/scripts/entrypoint

See /opt/scripts/setup inside the container or scripts/setup relative to the
dockerfile for the available variables that can be passed to this container.
Also check official docker registry config for config inherited from the 
registry image.

To generate id_rsa annd the private htpasswd run this container with the
run command provided, and then the docker-registry.service systemd unit can
be installed on the host
